# Introduction

This Rmarkdown file is part of the
[**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) package.
This package was created in conjunction with the office of the
[*Research Data Center* at *McMaster
University*](https://rdc.mcmaster.ca/), the [*Sherman Centre for Digital
Scholarship*](https://scds.ca/) and the [*Mobilizing
Justice*](https://mobilizingjustice.ca/)[^1].

[^1]: The Mobilizing Justice project is a multidisciplinary and
    multi-sector collaboration with the objective of understand and
    address transportation poverty in Canada and to improve the
    well-being of Canadians at risk of transport poverty. The Social
    Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSRHC) has provided
    funding for the project, which was created by an unprecedented
    alliance of academics from various Canadian provinces and
    institutions, transportation firms, and nonprofit organizations

The [**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) R
package was created to develop standardized methods for transport
analysis in research, particularly for analysis using the [*2021 Census of
Population*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm) from Statistics Canada. We focused our efforts on the [_Commuting Reference Guide_](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/011/98-500-x2021011-eng.cfm),
which provides valuable variables and information on commuting for the Canadian population aged 15 and older living in private households. 

This R markdown aims to provide a brief introduction of `R` language and
the concepts of data. This notebook[^2] is an updated and reduced
version of the computational notebooks available in the
[*edashop*](https://paezha.github.io/edashop/) package. The *edashop*
package is an open educational resource to teach a workshop on EDA using
R and computational notebooks, created and maintained by Dr. Antonio
Paez, co-author of the *CommuteCA* package. For those interested in
learning EDA in more deep, we suggest installing and studying the
*edashop* package.

[^2]: We will explain what a R markdown and a notebook are in the
    following sections.

In this first R markdown, we will learn about:

-   Literate programming
-   Data objects and basic operations
-   Ways of measuring stuff
-   Data manipulation with {dplyr}

# Literate programming

This is an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document, a
plain text file that recognizes code chunks and displays results beneath
them. R Markdown files are computational notebooks following [literate
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), which
emphasizes natural language for human communication and code for
computer communication, making coding more intuitive.

Structure of an R Markdown Document:

-   Header (YAML Header): At the top, between ---, includes metadata
    like title, author(s), and processing instructions.
-   Body: Main content, including text and code.

Code chunks are essential in computational notebooks and can be executed
to see results. Try the example below:

```{r}
print("Hello, CommuteCA")
```

The print() function displays the argument on the screen.

R Markdown documents prioritize humans and use R for illustrations. The
computer assists in demonstrating concepts, like code chunks.

Each R markdown of this packages serves as lecture notes and can be knit
into a `pdf` for study. These documents can be the foundation for
experiments and annotations, allowing you to customize notes with your
understanding and additional information. The original notebook is
available for fresh starts.

It's good practice to clear the working memory in RStudio before
starting new work. This ensures no extraneous information is in memory
that might confuse your tasks. Use the rm command in R to clear the
workspace by removing items. To clear all objects, run:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

Here, ls() lists all objects in the workspace. Alternatively, click the
broom icon in the 'Environment' tab in RStudio.

# Data objects and basic operations

R can handle different data types, including scalars, vectors, and
matrices. The following code chunks illustrate these data types:

-   *Scalar*: A scalar is an object with one element (one row and one
    column):

```{r}
1
```

-   *Vector*: A vector is a data object with one row and multiple
    columns:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

-   *Matrix*: A matrix has multiple rows and columns. This example has
    three rows and three columns:

```{r}
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

In general, matrices can be of size $n \times m$, meaning they have $n$
rows and $m$ columns. The c() command concatenates inputs, while
matrix() creates a matrix with specified nrow and ncol.

An important data class in R is the data frame, a rectangular table of
rows and columns, often consisting of vectors combined for convenience.
Data frames store data digitally and resemble tables in spreadsheet
software.

Data frames can hold large amounts of information (up to several billion
items, depending on your computer's memory). They can include numeric,
alphanumeric (characters), logical (TRUE/FALSE) data, etc. Each cell has
an address identified by its row and column, allowing R to perform
mathematical operations. R typically labels columns alphabetically and
rows numerically.

To illustrate a data framework, we will create the following vectors for
some Canadian provinces. This data comes from the [Statistics
Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/14-20-0001/142000012019001-eng.htm).
The first vector includes the names of the provinces; the second vector
contains the population (2021); the second contains the population
percentage change from 2016 to 2021; the next is the number of active
workers (in April 2021); and finally, there is a vector with the area of
the province in square kilometers:

```{r}
province_name <- c("Alberta",
                  "British Columbia",
                  "Ontario",
                  "Quebec",
                  "Newfoundland and Labrador",
                  "Manitoba",
                  "Saskatchewan")
population <- c(4262635,
                5000879,
                14223942,
                8501833,
                510550,
                1342153,
                1132505)
population_change  <- c(4.8,
                     7.6,
                    5.8,
                    4.1,
                    -1.8,
                    5.0,
                    3.1)
workers <- c(1897337,
               2263247,
               6279827,
               3693457,
               209649,
               599534,
               470931)
area_km2 <- c(634658.27,
              920686.55,
              892411.76,
              1298599.75,
              358170.37,
              540310.19,
              577060.40)
```

Note that \<- is an assignment operator in R, used to assign the value
on the right to the name on the left. This allows easy retrieval of
values later. After executing the previous code chunk, five vectors
appear in your Environment (upper right pane tab). These vectors are of
size 1:7, consisting of one alphanumeric ('chr', for 'character') and
four numeric ('num') vectors.

## Creating a Data Frame

Vectors can be assembled into a data frame, which is convenient when
data are related. To create a data frame, vectors must have the same
length; data frames do not support vectors with differing row numbers.
Let's create a data frame named `df` (you can choose a different name).
Some rules for naming objects include starting with a letter and using
letters, digits, periods, and underscores. Names should be intuitive,
easy to remember, and concise.

Use the data.frame() function to create a data frame, with vectors as
its arguments:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(province_name,
                 population,
                 population_change,
                 workers,
                 area_km2)
```

Running the above chunk creates a new object in your environment: a data
frame called `df`. Data frames are rectangular tables, so all vectors
must be the same length. For instance, if we have seven municipalities
but data for only six, we can exclude the one missing information or
include it with missing values, ensuring vectors remain the same size.

Double-click `df` in the Environment tab to see that it has four columns
(labeled `province_name`, `population`, `population_change`, `workers`,
`area_km2`), and 7 rows. Row numbers and column names identify specific
cells. You can enter data into a data frame and use R's built-in
functions for analysis. Display the data frame by typing its name as an
R command:

```{r}
df
```

The variable `province_name` at the moment is a character vector. If we
check the structure of the data frame we can see this:

```{r}
str(df)
```

The summary of the names of the provinces is:

```{r}
summary(df$province_name)
```

This shows that the column class is 'character'. A character variable
can be converted into a factor. Factors are used for categorical data
(e.g., labels, names, classes) and typically have two or more levels. In
this case, `province_name` has seven levels, representing Canada's
provinces. With multiple time periods, each province might appear more
than once. Convert `province_name` to a factor:

```{r}
df$province_name <- factor(df$province_name)
```

Reference columns in a data frame using `$` after the table name. The
`<-` operator assigns the result of `factor(df$province_name)` to the
province_name column in `df`. We could store it in a new data frame, but
it's unnecessary now. The `factor()` function converts a variable to a
factor:

```{r}
str(df)
```

Compare the factor summary to the character variable summary:

```{r}
summary(df$province_name)
```

## Basic operations

R can perform various operations, including arithmetic (sums,
multiplications) and logical (TRUE/FALSE) operations. To perform
operations effectively, it's important to understand how R locates
information, such as in a data frame. Each grid cell has an address,
known as an index, which can be referenced in several ways. For example,
to reference the first value in the data frame, specifically row 1 of
the column `province_name`, use square brackets with row and column
indices separated by a comma:

```{r}
df[1, 1]
```

This recalls the element in the first row and first column of `df`.
Alternatively, you can type:

```{r}
df$province_name[1]
```

Both methods yield the same result. The `$` symbol is used to reference
columns in a data frame, so R calls the first element of `province_name`
in `df`. To reference the second province in the table:

```{r}
df$province_name[2]
```

Requesting `df[1,1]` is the same as `df$province_name[1]`. To recall the
full column of province names, type `df$province_name`.

## Indexing for operations

Indexing is useful for operations. To calculate the total number of
workers in two provinces, say Alberta and British Columbia, execute:

```{r}
df$workers[1] + df$workers[2]
```

An issue with indexing cells by row number is that if new provinces are
added, the row numbers might change, leading to incorrect references.
Additionally, in large tables, it's difficult to know which province
corresponds to which row. A better approach is using logical operators
to index data frame cells, as shown below. Here, we ask for the sum of
"workers of (province which is Alberta)" and "workers of (province which
is British Columbia)":

```{r}
df$workers[df$province_name == "Alberta"] + df$workers[df$province_name == "British Columbia"]
```

Inside the square brackets, R checks for the row with the specified
province name (indexing by province name rather than row number), and
the text before the brackets refers to the workers column in the indexed
row.

To calculate the total area (in square kilometers) in the data frame,
use the sum function, identifying the column to sum with \$:

```{r}
sum(df$area_km2)
```

As demonstrated, R can function as a calculator, but it's much more
powerful. You can store instruction results in memory using assignment
(`<-`). Many other operations are possible, such as finding the maximum
value in a set:

```{r}
max(df$area_km2)
```

The max() function can be used to find the maximum of any set of values,
not just a single column:

```{r}
max(df$area_km2[df$province_name == "Ontario"], df$area_km2[df$province_name == "Quebec"])
```

To find the province with the largest area:

```{r}
df$province_name[df$area_km2 == max(df$area_km2)]
```

This shows that Quebec has the largest territorial area. Similarly, use
`min()` to find the minimum value:

```{r}
min(df$area_km2)
```

To find the province with the smallest area:

```{r}
df$province_name[df$area_km2 == min(df$area_km2)]
```

## Exploring data with calculations

R has a high flexibility and allows for various calculations to explore
and analyze data. You can perform operations on single columns or use
multiple columns in a data frame. For instance, the sample data frame
contains information about Canadian provinces. To discover the
population density of the provinces, we can perform calculations across
several columns.

To define the population density by province, calculate the population
by area in squared kilometers in each province:

$$
PD_i = \frac{population_i}{area\_km_i}
$$

Where $PD_i$ is the population density in province $i$.

The text enclosed by `$$` is *LaTeX* code, allowing you to type
mathematical formulas in R Markdown. Inline mathematical expressions can
be written using the notation $x$. Learning to write these expressions
is optional, and numerous online [resources
online](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) can help you
get started.

To calculate the population density :

```{r}
PD <- df$population/df$area_km2
```

The code above creates a new vector `PD`. To add this vector as a new
column in the data frame:

```{r}
df$PD <- df$population/df$area_km2
```

You can add new columns in real time, ensuring the assigned data size
matches the data frame (same number of rows). Verify the new column in
your `df` data frame:

```{r}
df
```

To round off numeric data values, use the round() function. Here, we
round to two decimals:

```{r}
df$PD <- round(df$population/df$area_km2, 2)
```

# Ways of measuring stuff

Merriam-Webster[^3] defines data as *a factual information (such as
measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion,
or calculation*. Data arise from observations, and measurement theory is
the mathematical framework for recording these observations.
Measurements focus on specific attributes of an object, like weight,
density, height, or price, rather than encompassing all its
characteristics. This distinction highlights that a measurement captures
a particular aspect rather than the entirety of the subject being
measured.

[^3]: <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data>

There are several typologies that describe appropriate [scales of
measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement).
[Stanley Smith
Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens), a notable
psychologist, identified four such scales, two of which are categorical
and two are quantitative.

## Categorical: Nominal Scale

The nominal scale is the most basic form of measurement, used to assign
unique labels or categories to items. It compresses complex information
into simple, recognizable categories. Examples include modes of
transportation such as "car," "bus," "walk," and "bicycle," or brands
like "Apple," "Huawei," and "Nokia." Importantly, nominal categories do
not have an inherent order; for example, "car" is not inherently higher
or closer to "bicycle."

These categories can be compared using Boolean operations:

```{r}
"car" == "car"  # returns TRUE
"car" == "bus"  # returns FALSE
```

## Categorical: Ordinal scale

Ordinal scale measurements are categorical but include a natural order
among categories. These are often used in [Likert-style
scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale), such as five-point
scales ranging from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree," with a
midpoint of "Neutral." The key difference from the nominal scale is that
ordinal categories have a meaningful sequence: "Strongly Disagree" is
closer to "Disagree" than to "Neutral," and "Strongly Agree" is further
from "Neutral."

Sometimes quantitative variables, like income, are collected and
reported using ordinal scales, such as income brackets:

-   Less than 20,000
-   Between 20,000 and 40,000
-   More than 40,000

Like nominal variables, different categories can be compared with
boolean operations "==" and "!=" (i.e., not equal to). In addition, the
following operations are also valid: "\<" and "\<=" (i.e., *less than*)
and "\>" (i.e., greater than).

## Quantitative: Interval scale

In the ordinal scale, categories have a natural order, but the
differences between them are not quantified. For example, income
categories like "less than 20,000" and "more than 40,000" can be
ordered, but the difference between them isn't a specific dollar amount.
Likewise, Likert scale responses (e.g., "Strongly Agree") reflect
subjective attitudes that vary among individuals and can't be precisely
measured.

The interval scale also has an order, but unlike the ordinal scale, the
differences between values are meaningful. Examination scores, such as
on a 1-100 scale, exemplify this: the difference between 80 and 90 is 10
points. However, zero doesn't imply a total absence of knowledge, nor
does 100 indicate complete understanding. Interval scales allow
operations like addition and subtraction, providing more quantitative
insight than ordinal scales.

## Quantitative: Ratio scale

The interval scale is more informative than the ordinal scale because it
allows consistent quantification of differences between values. However,
the ratio between two values is not meaningful because interval
variables lack a natural origin. For instance, a score of 20 does not
represent infinitely more knowledge than a score of zero, nor does 100
indicate twice the knowledge of a score of 50.

Ratio variables have a natural origin, meaning a value of zero indicates
the absence of what is being measured. For example, a length of zero
means no length, and an income of zero means no income. This allows all
operations valid for interval variables and additionally enables
multiplication and division. For instance, an income of 40,000 is twice
as much as an income of 20,000.

# Classes of objects in R

In `R`, data classes differentiate between categorical and quantitative
variables. Consider these vectors:

```{r}
modes <- c("car", "bus", "walk", "walk", "car", "walk", "walk", "car")
frequency <- c(6, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4)
safe <- c(5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4)
```

Check their classes:

```{r}
class(modes)
class(frequency)
class(safe)
```

We can see that modes is a character vector (nominal, categorical);
frequency is a numeric vector (quantitative); safe is numeric but should
be ordinal.

To properly code modes and safe as factors:

```{r}
modes <- factor(modes, levels = c("bus", "car", "walk"))
safe <- factor(safe,
               levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
               labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
               ordered = TRUE)
```

Check the updated classes:

```{r}
class(modes)
class(safe)
```

Now, modes and safe are factors, with safe being an ordinal factor.
Properly defining scales allows R to perform appropriate operations. For
example:

```{r}
modes[1] == modes[3]
```

This checks if the modes are the same for respondents 1 and 3, while
operations like summing categorical data (e.g., "car" + "walk") are not
defined.

```{r}
modes[1] + modes[3]
```

With ordinal variables we can compare the relative values of levels:

```{r}
safe[1] >= safe[2]
```

As noted above, though, the difference between levels is not meaningful:

```{r}
safe[1] - safe[2]
```

In contrast, frequency is a ratio variable, and this is a meaningful
operation:

```{r}
frequency[1]/7
```

The above is the proportion of the week that Respondent 1 uses the mode
indicated. Here we collect the vectors in a data frame, which we are
going to call unimaginatively `df`:

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(modes, frequency, safe)
```

Since `R` understands the classes of the variables, it is possible to
obtain quick summaries of the data:

```{r}
summary(df2)
```

Function `summary()` uses appropriate methods for the data.

# Data manipulation with `dplyr`

A package is a shareable code unit that enhances `R` capabilities.
Packages are commonly installed from
{[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)} (Comprehensive R Archive Network),
which manages dependencies to ensure packages work together smoothly.
Install packages from `CRAN` using `install.packages()`. A valuable
package set is {[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)} (the name is a
riff on "data plier"), it provides numerous functions for data
"carpentry" or data "wrangling". What distinguishes the package is that
functions are implemented following a consistent *grammar* of data
manipulation. Data are manipulated using "verbs" that act on data
objects. Verbs can be linked by means of *pipes* to form complete
*phrases* of data manipulation.[^4]

[^4]: You can install `dplyr` directly from CRAN using
    `install.packages(dplyr)`. If you have the `CommuteCA` package
    installed, all the packages required for all sessions will be
    already installed.

Load package:

```{r}
library(dplyr) # A Grammar of Data Manipulation
```

The R community has developed consistent standards for sharing packages,
emphasizing the importance of documentation. Good documentation is a
hallmark of a quality package. To consult the help pages for a package
or its contents, use the following function:

``` r
?dplyr
```

One way of manipulate Data Frames in `R` is using pipe. Piping passes
information from one function to another, enhancing code readability. R
supports two pipe operators: `%>%` from the {magrittr} package and `|>`
natively in base R (version 4.1 and later). For example:

```{r}
df2 |> 
  summary()
```

This code means *"pass data frame df2 to the summary() function."* Pipes
improve code clarity by chaining functions in a straightforward manner.

Previously we saw how indexing works to call *parts* of data frames, in
other words, to *subset* data frames. Recall that we can retrieve a
column from a data frame by naming it:

```{r}
df2$modes
```

Similarly, we can retrieve rows as follows. Suppose that we want the
first row from the table:

```{r}
df2[1,]
```

Or the first two rows:

```{r}
df2[1:2,]
```

Or rows 1, 3, and 5:

```{r}
df2[c(1, 3, 5),]
```

As an alternative scenario, suppose that we want to extract only the
rows corresponding to "walk":

```{r}
df2[df2$modes == "walk",]
```

{dplyr} implements several verbs that are useful to subset a data frame.
The verb `select()` acts on columns. For instance, with piping:

```{r}
df2 |>
  select(modes)
```

The above is read as "take data frame `df2` and select column `modes`".
It is possible to select by negation:

```{r}
df2 |>
  select(-modes)
```

As well, it is possible to select multiple columns:

```{r}
df2 |>
  select(modes, safe)
```

Or:

```{r}
df2 |>
  select(-modes, -safe)
```

Verb `slice()` acts on rows. For example:

```{r}
df2 |>
  slice(1)
```

The above is read as *"take data frame `df2` and slice the first row"*.
The following chunk implements *"take data frame `df2` and slice rows
one to two"*:

```{r}
df2 |>
  slice(1:2)
```

Or *"slice rows 1, 3, and 5"*:

```{r}
df2 |>
  slice(c(1, 3, 5))
```

The following variations of `slice()` are available: `slice_head()`,
`slice_tail()`, `slice_min()`, `slice_max()`, and `slice_sample()`. Use
`?` to check the documentation.

Another verb, `filter()`, also acts on rows, but instead of retrieving
them by position does it by some condition. The following *phrase*
implements *"take data frame `df2` and filter all rows where the `mode`
is equal to `walk`"*:

```{r}
df2 |>
  filter(modes == "walk")
```

The value of a grammatical approach with piping becomes more evident
when we wish to form more complex *phrases* of data manipulation and
analysis. For example:

```{r}
summary(df2[df2$modes == "walk",])
```

In the above, the arguments are nested and the phrase has to be read
from inside out, as it were. Compare to the more linear grammar of the
following chunk:

```{r}
df2 |> 
  filter(modes == "walk") |>
  summary()
```

## Creating new variables

To create a new column `id` with unique identifiers:

```{r}
df2 <- df2 |>
  mutate(id = factor(1:n()))
```

Here, `n()` returns the number of rows, and `mutate()` adds the new id
column to `df2`. Remember to reassign the result to `df2` to retain the
changes. To convert `frequency` from days per week to the proportion of
the week:

```{r}
df2 |>
  mutate(frequency = frequency/7)
```

This replaces the existing frequency column with its proportionate
value. Another verb, `transmute()` combines the behavior of `select()`
and `mutate()`. See for instance:

```{r}
df2 |>
  transmute(id,
            frequency = frequency/7)
```

Verb `relocate()` changes the order of columns:

```{r}
df2 |>
  mutate(frequency = frequency/7) |>
  relocate(id,
           .before = "modes")
```

## Working on groups of cases

To summarize data by groups, you can use `group_by()` in conjunction
with `summarize()` from the {dplyr} package. Here's how you can
calculate the mean proportion of mode use by travel mode:

```{r}
df2 |>
  group_by(modes) |>
  summarize(mean_frequency = mean(frequency),
            .groups = "drop")
```

The argument `.groups = "drop"` ungroups the output of the phrase. It is
possible to group by various variables, for example:

```{r}
df2 |>
  group_by(modes, 
           safe) |>
  summarize(mean_frequency = mean(frequency),
            .groups = "drop")
```

Grouping is a powerful way to work simultaneously on separate parts of a
data frame.
