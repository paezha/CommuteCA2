\description{
This object contains the census tracts (CT) for all census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations (2021),
with land use information regarding the number of labour force (estimated) and number of jobs of each CT.
CTs are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population of fewer than 7,500 persons,
based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. They are located in census metropolitan areas (CMAs)
and in census agglomerations (CAs) that had a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census.
The labour force and number of jobs in each CT was obtained from the Census of Population. We estimated the labour force
by calculating the proportion of trips made by each mode of transport in each census tract, then distributing
non-commuters (people who either don't work or work from home) among these transport modes. The number of jobs was obtained
applying the weighted sum for cases of respondents mentioning working in the DA.  Only cases of CT in accordance
with the Research Data Centre vetting rules were released. The methodology to obtain this data set is described in the
R markdown 'making-data-v2.Rmd'.
