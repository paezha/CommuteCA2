# Introduction

This Rmarkdown file is part of the
[**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) package.
This package was created in conjunction with the office of the
[*Research Data Center* at *McMaster
University*](https://rdc.mcmaster.ca/), the [*Sherman Centre for Digital
Scholarship*](https://scds.ca/) and the [*Mobilizing
Justice*](https://mobilizingjustice.ca/)[^1].

[^1]: The Mobilizing Justice project is a multidisciplinary and
    multi-sector collaboration with the objective of understand and
    address transportation poverty in Canada and to improve the
    well-being of Canadians at risk of transport poverty. The Social
    Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSRHC) has provided
    funding for the project, which was created by an unprecedented
    alliance of academics from various Canadian provinces and
    institutions, transportation firms, and nonprofit organizations

The [**CommuteCA**](https://github.com/dias-bruno/CommuteCA) R
package was created to develop standardized methods for transport
analysis in research, particularly for analysis using the [*2021 Census of
Population*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm) from Statistics Canada. We focused our efforts on the [_Commuting Reference Guide_](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/98-500/011/98-500-x2021011-eng.cfm),
which provides valuable variables and information on commuting for the Canadian population aged 15 and older living in private households. 

Considering the number of workers and employment opportunities obtained
from the [*2021 Census of
Population*](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm),
this R markdown aims to create a methodology to obtain Hansen-type
accessibility [@hansen1959] and spatial accessibility [@soukhov2023],
for any Canadian provinces and territories, considering different modes
of travel.

## Data

For the Census Tract level analysis, *CommuteCA* provides data set with land use tables that contains the labour force by transportation mode, and number of jobs in each Census Tract. Information about the file can be seen by: 

```{r}
library('CommuteCA') # Access data sets from CommuteCA R package
#?census_tracts_ca21
```

We will also use the travel time table created in the previous step, in
the R markdown called *03_travel_times.Rmd*.

# Measuring accessibility

In transportation research, accessibility is a location-based
measure[^6] that refers to the potential of a *population* to reach
spatially distributed *opportunities*[^7]. These often include
destinations that are important to ensure that all members of society
can lead plentiful, meaningful lives, such as jobs, parks, cultural
activities, health services, education, and, in our case, *jobs*.

[^6]: Location-based metrics measure accessibility as a characteristic
    of a given location, assuming that all people in the same location
    have equal access to activities distributed throughout the city.
    Such measures are sensitive to land use and transportation factors
    related to the spatial distribution of activities and the
    configuration and performance of the transportation network.
    However, they do not take into account the individual
    characteristics of people.

[^7]: We strongly recommend reading the report by Soukhov and Páez
    (2024), which provides a detailed explanation of the components of
    accessibility analysis, as well as their possible uses in equity
    planning

For our purposes, the population is the people residing in some origin
(a CT) on the date of May 11, 2021[^8], and the opportunities are the
jobs located in a given destination (a CT) with which the population
interacts. The population uses a mode of transportation (for example,
walking, cycling, public transit, car, motorcycle) to reach their
destination, with a certain travel cost (distance, time, monetary cost
or a combination of several factors).

[^8]: Date used as reference for the 2021 Population Census

The result of the accessibility model is a value assigned to each
spatial unit - usually at the origin. Areas with high accessibility
values have more connections and are closer to more opportunities, while
areas with low values have the opposite.

## Hansen-type accessibility (HT)

The measure of Hansen [-@hansen1959] considers that the sum of
opportunities in each destination in gradually discounted as the travel
cost increases. In this case, opportunities that area easier to access
counts more for the measure. Many accessibility measures derive from
this work [@MJ-A2-0002], according to the equation:

$$ HT_i = \sum_{j=1}^{J}O_j \cdot f(c_{ij})$$

Where:

-   $i$ and $j$: set of spatial units in a region.
-   $O_j$: number of opportunities $O$ at destinations $j$.
-   $f(c_{ij})$: travel cost function, also called decay-function or
    impedance function.
-   $HT_i$: accessibility score at the origin $i$ being represented by
    the weighted sum of opportunities considering all destinations
    $O_j$.

## Impedance functions

The impedance function $f(c_{ij})$ reveals important information about
the travel behavior of the population, as it represents the relationship
between the "population" at an origin and where they usually go, want to
go, or can go to reach the "opportunities" at the destinations.
Therefore, defining the impedance function is extremely important.

The decay rate of the impedance function needs to be calibrated if one
wants the accessibility estimates to be representative of the people's
travel behavior. In our case, we'll use the Census data in the
calibration process.

Soukhov and Páez [-@MJ-A2-0002] reviewed commonly used impedance
functions $f(\bullet)$ in accessibility research, explaining their
impacts on the summation of opportunities at specific travel costs
$c_{ij}$. In this study, we will explore the following functions to
determine the impedance function that best fits our data:
[exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution),
[gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution),
[log-normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution),
[normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), and
[uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution).

## Spatial Availability

Often, access to opportunities is affected by competition among many
people seeking the same opportunity, not just by geographic proximity
and transportation costs [@pereira2023]. If competition is not taken
into account, it is assumed that the opportunity is equally available to
all individuals who seek the opportunity and can reach it - which is not
a problem if the opportunity of interest is not exclusive, so that use
by one person does not prevent use by another.

Hansen [-@hansen1959], apart from his innovative implementation of an
accessibility measure, does not consider competition in the distribution
of opportunities. Also, this measure is considered an unconstrained
measure, which means that the same opportunity can be allocated to
different origins, making it difficult to interpret the result. Another
difficulty in interpreting the result is caused by the way in which the
number of job opportunities is discounted by the cost of travel.

With the goal of including competition in the accessibility measures and
constraining the opportunity calculation to a known quantity,
[@soukhov2023] created the *spatial availability* measure. This study
also provides a more interpretable result because it guarantees that the
measures are summed to a predetermined value, e.g. the total number of
jobs in a region, so that each value at the origin can be meaningfully
related to this total.

$$ SA_i = \sum_{j=1}^{J}O_j \cdot F_{ij}^t$$

Where:

-   $SA_i$ is the number of spatially available opportunities from the
    perspective of $i$.
-   $O_j$ is the number of opportunities $O$ at the destination $j$.
-   $F_{ij}$ is a balancing factor that depends on the population and
    cost of travel in the system.

Being $f(c_{ij})$ the impedance function and $P_i$ is the population at
origin i, the balancing factor $F_{ij}$ consists of two components:

-   $F_{i}^{p}$, a population-based balancing factor that allocate
    opportunities to $i$ in proportion to the size of the population of
    the different competing centers. With:

$$F_{i}^{p} = \frac{P_i}{\sum_{i}P_i}$$

-   and $F_{ij}^{c}$, an impedance-based balancing factor that
    represents the cost of reaching opportunities. With:

$$F_{i}^{c} = \frac{f_{(c_ij)}}{\sum_{i}f_{(c_{ij})}}$$ We can obtain
$F_{ij}$ by:
$$ F_{ij}^{t} = \frac{F_i^{p} \cdot F_{ij}^{(c_ij)}}{\sum_{i}F_i^{p} \cdot F_{ij}^{(c_ij)}} $$

# Let's code!

The methodology for obtaining the accessibility measures for Census Tract:

1.  First, we estimate the travel time for each transportation mode using the [{r5r}](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html) package [@Pereira2021], considering all possible combinations of census tracts of the selected study area. The methodology used to obtain the travel time table is in the *03_travel_times.Rmd*. 

2.  Next, we read the land use table of our city of study. This table contains the labour force population and the number of job opportunities for each census tract.

3.  We select the impedance functions from our city of study. 

4.  We then apply the impedance functions to the travel time table.

5.  We join the travel time and labour force tables, creating the accessibility table. This last table has all the data needed to carry out the accessibility analysis. 

6.  Finally, we perform the Hansen accessibility type and the spatial availability.

code <- 3520 # selected census division (Toronto)

# Filtering by census division
land_use <- land_use_CT_mode %>% filter(PCD == code) # Only select respondents who live in the selected PCD
```

Pre-processing our land use table:
```{r}
# Rename columns
land_use <- land_use %>% 
  rename(jobs = jobs_rounded,
         labour_force = labour_force_est_rounded)

land_use_exp <- expand.grid(CTUID = unique(land_use$CTUID),
                            PwMode = unique(land_use$PwMode))

land_use_exp <- land_use_exp %>%
  left_join(land_use[,c("CTUID","PwMode","labour_force")], 
            by = c("CTUID" = "CTUID","PwMode" = "PwMode")) %>% 
  left_join(land_use[,c("CTUID","PwMode","jobs")],
            by = c("CTUID" = "CTUID", "PwMode" = "PwMode"))

land_use_exp[is.na(land_use_exp$labour_force),]$labour_force <- 0

land_use_exp <- land_use_exp %>%
  group_by(CTUID) %>%
  mutate(jobs = ifelse(is.na(jobs), 
                       max(jobs, na.rm = TRUE), # Use max to get a non-NA value
                       jobs)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Verifying the number of people within labour force and number of jobs:
```{r}
# labour fource
sum(land_use_exp$labour_force)

# Job opportunities
land_use_exp %>% 
  group_by(CTUID) %>%
  summarize(jobs = first(jobs)) %>%
  dplyr::select(jobs) %>%
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```
# Impedance functions

All of the impedance functions mentioned require the analyst to define
parameters. One useful technique is to create a trip length distribution
(TLD) using empirically observed origin-destination travel survey data.
A TLD reflects observed travel patterns: specifically, the probability
of an observed trip of a given travel cost occurring for the population
in a region of interest. Based on the TLD, we can select the most
appropriate theoretical PDF forms (e.g., uniform, exponential, gamma),
adjust the associated parameters, and use the calibrated theoretical PDF
to incorporate the assumptions about the population's travel behavior
into the accessibility calculation.

Soukhov and Páez [-@MJ-A2-0002] demonstrated the process of calibrating
and selecting the best distribution to represent an impedance function
based on travel flows from workers who live and work (full-time) within
the City of Hamilton. The authors used the data from the R data package
[{TTS2016R}](https://soukhova.github.io/TTS2016R/) and the R package
[{fitdistrplus}](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html)
to generate parameters that best fit the TLD the parameters of the
uniform, exponential, and gamma functions as closely to the TLD.

We already calibrated impedance functions based on travel time distribution for all Canadian cities, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, and Province or Territories. We selected the best impedance function based on the on the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)[^12], selects the better function between the distributions:
[exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution),
[gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution),
[log-normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution),
[normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), and
[uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution).

[^12]: The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) estimates prediction error
    and model quality for a given data set.

The chunk below display how to obtain the impedance function for my city of study: 

```{r pcd-functions}
data("pcd_impedance_functions")

specific_function <- pcd_impedance_functions %>%
  filter(PCD == code)

specific_function
```

In some cases, calibrated functions may not be available for all transportation modes. This is due to RDC vetting rules that prevent the release of data or statistics for spatial units with low populations. However, we also provide datasets at other spatial levels, specifically for Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA)/Census Agglomerations (CA), and Provinces/Territories.

If a city lacks an impedance function for a specific mode, we recommend using the CMA impedance function for that mode. If the city is within a CMA without a calibrated impedance function or is outside a CMA entirely, we suggest using the provincial impedance function, considering the city’s level of metropolitan influence.

```{r cma-functions}
data("cma_impedance_functions")

CMA_RANGES <- list(
  STRONG_METRO = 996,
  MODERATE_METRO = 997,
  WEAK_METRO = 998,
  NO_METRO = 999,
  TERRITORIES = 0
)

add_new_row <- function(source_df, mode, code, specific_function) {
  new_row <- source_df
  new_row$PCD <- code
  new_row <- new_row %>% dplyr::select(names(specific_function))
  rbind(specific_function, new_row)
}

if (nrow(specific_function) < 4) {
  for (mode in c('Bike', 'Walk', 'Car/motor', 'Transit')) {
    if (!(mode %in% specific_function$PwMode)) {
      cma_value <- specific_function$CMA[1]
      
      if (cma_value > 0 && cma_value < 996) {
        cma_row <- cma_impedance_functions %>%
          filter(PwMode == mode, CMA == cma_value)
        
        if (nrow(cma_row) > 0) {
          specific_function <- add_new_row(cma_row, mode, code, specific_function)
        }
      }
      
      if (nrow(specific_function) < 4 && cma_value %in% unlist(CMA_RANGES)) {
        cma_type <- switch(
          as.character(cma_value),
          "996" = "Strong metropolitan influenced zone",
          "997" = "Moderate metropolitan influenced zone",
          "998" = "Weak metropolitan influenced zone",
          "999" = "No metropolitan influenced zone",
          "0" = "Territories (outside CAs)"
        )
        
        pr_row <- pr_impedance_functions %>%
          filter(PwMode == mode, Pr == specific_function$Pr[1], CMA_type == cma_type)
        
        if (nrow(pr_row) > 0) {
          pr_row$CMA <- cma_value  # Ensure CMA value is consistent
          specific_function <- add_new_row(pr_row, mode, code, specific_function)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```


# Reading and preparing the travel matrix table

Reading the travel time table created in the *03_travel_times.Rmd*^[*If you are working with another study area or with the original Census data, don't forget to change the address file for the next chunk.*]:

```{r read-ttm}
ttm <- read_csv(paste0(here(),"/data-raw/CT/travel_times/PCD3520/ttm.csv"),
                col_types = cols(
                  from_id = col_character(),   
                  to_id = col_character(),
                  travel_time = col_double(),
                  PwMode = col_character(),
                  PCD = col_character(),
                  CMA = col_character(),
                  PRUID = col_character()))
```

```{r}
ttm[1:10,]
```

Visualizing some statistics about the travel time matrix:

```{r ttm-statistics}
ttm %>% 
  group_by(PwMode) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tt = mean(travel_time),
            median_tt = median(travel_time),
            min_tt = min(travel_time),
            max_tt = max(travel_time))
```

The value of impedance function for each origin-destination-mode will be
obtained using travel time of the ttm table and the best impedance
function based on the empirical length distributions.

```{r}
generate_impedance <- function(mode_function, travel_cost){
  
  f <- 0
  
  # lnorm impedance 
  if(mode_function$distribution == "lnorm"){
  f <- dlnorm(travel_cost,
                    meanlog = mode_function$est_1,
                    sdlog = mode_function$est_2)
  }
  
  # Unif impedance 
  else if(mode_function$distribution == "unif") {
   f <- dunif(travel_cost,
                     min = 0,
                     max = mode_function$est_2)
   
  # Exponential impedance 
  } else if(mode_function$distribution == "exp") {
    f <- rescale(dexp(travel_cost,
                    rate = mode_function$est_1))
    
  # Gamma impedance 
  } else if (mode_function$distribution == "gamma"){  
    f <- dgamma(travel_cost,
                    shape = mode_function$est_1,
                    rate = mode_function$est_2)
    
  # Norm impedance 
  } else if (mode_function$distribution == "norm"){
        f <- dnorm(travel_cost,
                    mean = mode_function$est_1,
                    sd = mode_function$est_2)
        }
  
  return(f)
}
```


```{r impedance-function-CT, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ttm_f <- data.frame()

ttm[ttm$travel_time == 0,]$travel_time <- 0.1

for(mode in unique(ttm$PwMode)){
  
  ttm_f_mode <- ttm %>% 
    filter(PwMode == mode)
  
  pcd_mode_function <- specific_function %>%
    filter(PwMode == mode)
  
   ttm_f_mode$f <- generate_impedance(mode_function = pcd_mode_function,
                                travel_cost = ttm_f_mode$travel_time)
   
   ttm_f_mode$distribution <-  pcd_mode_function$distribution
   ttm_f_mode$est_1 <-  pcd_mode_function$est_1
   ttm_f_mode$est_2 <-  pcd_mode_function$est_2
   
   ttm_f <- rbind(ttm_f, ttm_f_mode)
}
```


# Building the accessibility table

The accessibility table is formed by the junction of the land use and
travel times tables:

```{r accessibility-table}
accessibility_table <- ttm_f %>% 
  left_join(land_use_exp[,c("CTUID","PwMode","labour_force")], 
            by = c("from_id" = "CTUID", "PwMode" = "PwMode")) %>%
  left_join(land_use_exp[,c("CTUID","PwMode","jobs")], 
            by = c("to_id" = "CTUID","PwMode" = "PwMode"))

accessibility_table[is.na(accessibility_table$labour_force),]$labour_force <- 0

accessibility_table <- accessibility_table %>%
   group_by(to_id) %>%
   mutate(jobs = ifelse(is.na(jobs), 
                        max(jobs, na.rm = TRUE), # Use max to get a non-NA value
                        jobs)) %>%
   ungroup()
```

Confirming the total number of jobs: 

```{r}
accessibility_table %>%
  group_by(to_id) %>%
  summarise(job = first(jobs)) %>%
  dplyr::select(job) %>%
  sum()
```
Checking the total population:

```{r}
accessibility_table %>%
  dplyr::distinct(from_id, PwMode, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(pop = sum(labour_force)) %>%
  dplyr::select(pop) %>%
  dplyr::pull(pop) %>%
  sum()
```

```{r}
CTUID <- land_use_exp %>%
  dplyr::distinct(CTUID, PwMode) %>%
  arrange(CTUID, PwMode) %>%
  rename(id = CTUID)
```

```{r}
from_id <- ttm %>%
  dplyr::distinct(from_id, PwMode) %>%
  arrange(from_id, PwMode) %>%
  rename(id = from_id)
```

```{r}
setdiff(CTUID, from_id)
```
# Calculating the Hansen Accessibility

Generating the Hansen Accessibility (HT):

```{r Si-hansen, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
accessibility_table <- accessibility_table %>%
  mutate(jobs_f = jobs * f)

HT_mode <- accessibility_table %>%
  group_by(from_id, PwMode) %>%
  summarize(HT_im = sum(jobs_f))
```

The *HT_mode* presents the value of job accessibility for each CT by
*mode*. The next chunk sum all *Si* values by CT of origin:

```{r Hansen-i-CT}
HT <- HT_mode %>%
  group_by(from_id) %>%
  summarize(HT_i = sum(HT_im))
```

Visualizing the sum of the Hansen Accessibility (HT)[^16]:

[^16]: Note that the value itself has no specific meaning, as it is just
    the sum of the "weighted" jobs, but it can be interpreted as a
    relative score of the potential interaction based on the observed
    travel patterns of people residing in the specified region.

```{r sum-HT}
sum(HT$HT_i)
```

# Calculating Spatial Availability

Now, we'll calculate the spatial availability. First, we'll define the
function:

```{r defining-spatial-availability-detailed-function}

#defining the spatial availability function

spatial_availability <- function(df, origin, destination, pop, opp, mode, f){
  
    origin <- rlang::enquo(origin)
    destination <- rlang::enquo(destination)
    pop <- rlang::enquo(pop)
    opp <- rlang::enquo(opp)
    mode <- rlang::enquo(mode)
    f <- rlang::enquo(f)
    
    # Calculate sum of population in the system
    sum_pop <- df %>%
    dplyr::distinct(!!origin, !!mode,  
                  .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(pop = (!!pop)) %>%
    dplyr::pull(pop) %>%
    sum()
  
    df$sum_pop <- sum_pop
    
    # Calculate f_p: population factor 
    f_p <- dplyr::pull(df, !!pop)/ sum_pop
    
    
    # Calculate sum of impedance
    sum_impedance <- df %>%
      dplyr::group_by(!!destination) %>%
      dplyr::summarize(sum_impedance = sum(!!f))
    
    df <- df %>%
      dplyr::left_join(sum_impedance, by = rlang::as_name(destination))

    # Calculate f_c: impedance factor 
    f_c <- dplyr::pull(df, !!f) / df$sum_impedance
    
    df$f_c <- f_c
    df$f_p <- f_p
    
    # Calculate f_p * f_c
    sum_pa <- df %>%
      dplyr::group_by(!!destination) %>%
      dplyr::summarize(sum_pa= sum(f_p * f_c))
    
    df <- df %>%
      dplyr::left_join(sum_pa,
                       by = rlang::as_name(destination))

    # Calculate f_t: balancing factor
    df$f_t <- (f_p * f_c) / dplyr::pull(df, sum_pa)
    
    # Calculate the Spatial Availability
    df %>%
      dplyr::mutate(SA_ij = !!opp * f_t)
}
```

Calculating the spatial availability:

```{r SA-soukov}
# Apply the function to accessibility_table
SA_ij_mode <- accessibility_table %>%
  spatial_availability(origin = from_id,
                      destination = to_id,
                      pop = labour_force,
                      mode = PwMode,
                      opp = jobs,
                      f = f)
```


```{r}
SA_ij_mode %>%
  group_by(to_id) %>%
  summarise(job = first(jobs)) %>%
  dplyr::select(job) %>%
  sum()
```

```{r}
sum(SA_ij_mode$SA_ij)
```

The table above displays the spatial availability for each combination
of origin, destination and mode. The next chunk synthesize the
information for each origin and mode:

```{r Vim}
SA_mode <- SA_ij_mode %>% 
  group_by(from_id,PwMode) %>%
  summarise(SA_im = sum(SA_ij))
```

The *SA_im* presents the value of spatial availability for each CT by
*mode*. The next chunk sum all *SA* values by CT of origin:

```{r V_i}
SA <- SA_mode %>%
  group_by(from_id) %>%
  summarize(SA_i = sum(SA_im))
```

Visualizing the sum of spatial availability:

```{r sum-Vi}
sum(SA$SA_i, na.rm = TRUE)
``` 

Note that the sum of spatial availability matches with the total amount
of job opportunities in the system. As explained above, this happens
because this metric is constrained.

```{r type-folder}
type = 'PCD'
```

Creating the directory:

```{r directory-export}
diretorio_export <- paste0(here::here(),"/data-raw/CT/output/", type, code, "/") #Update the address to export the data, if necessary
dir.create(diretorio_export)
```

Although we also export outputs not marked as released, only data marked as released is in a format suitable for sharing by the RDC. We are exporting this data because it is a good data management technique to keep full data available for possible future queries.

# Export tables

Export the original files for future consultations (this data can not be released by RDC):
```{r export-original-files}
# HT tables
write.csv(HT, paste0(diretorio_export, "HT_general.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(HT_mode, paste0(diretorio_export, "HT_mode.csv"), row.names=FALSE)

# SA tables
write.csv(SA, paste0(diretorio_export, "SA_general.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(SA_mode, paste0(diretorio_export, "SA_mode.csv"), row.names=FALSE)

# Land use table
land_use_mode <- land_use_exp %>%
  left_join(unique(land_use[,c("CTUID", "CTNAME", "CMAUID", "CMANAME", "PCD","PRUID")]), by = c("CTUID" = "CTUID"))
  
write.csv(land_use_mode, paste0(diretorio_export, "land_use_mode.csv"), row.names=FALSE)

land_use_general <- land_use_exp %>%
  left_join(land_use %>% 
                dplyr::select("CTUID","CTNAME","CMAUID",
                              "CMANAME","PCD","PRUID"), by =('CTUID'))
  
write.csv(land_use_general, paste0(diretorio_export, "land_use_general.csv"), row.names=FALSE)
```
